        <h2>Feature Branch Workflow</h2><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/01.svg">
        <p>All feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/07.svg">
        <p>By isolating features into separate branches, everybody can work independently, yet it’s still trivial to share changes with other developers when necessary.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Defines a strict branching model designed around the project release</li>
          <li>Provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.</li>
          <li>Assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.</li>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Gitflow Workflow uses a central repository with historical Branches</p><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/02.svg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Master Branch</h2>
        <p>The master branch stores the official release history</p>
        <p>It's convenient to tag all commits in the master branch with a version number</p><b>The Master Branch is the untouchable sanctuary! Do not touch it!!!</b><img src="http://www.funnysigns.net/files/please-keep-off-grass-400x268.jpg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Develop Branch</h2>
        <p>The Develop Branch serves as an integration branch for features</p>
        <p>Only simple tasks happen here like fixing a typo etc.</p>
        <p><b>Develop Branch is always stable!</b></p>
      </section>

        <h2>Feature Branches</h2><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/03.svg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Feature Branches</h2>
        <p>Each new feature should reside in its own branch</p>
        <p>Feature Branches use <strong>develop</strong> as their parent branch.</p>
        <p>When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.</p>
        <h4>Features should never interact directly with master!</h4>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Release Branches</h2><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/04.svg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Release Branches</h2>
        <p>Fork a release branch off of develop</p>
        <p>Creating this branch starts the next release cycle</p>
        <p><strong>No new features can be added after this point—only bug fixes!</strong></p>
        <p>Once it's ready to ship, the release gets merged into master</p>
        <p>Then, it should be merged back into develop</p>

        <h2>Maintenance Branches</h2><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/05.svg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Maintenance Branches</h2>
        <p>Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases</p>
        <p><strong>Only branch that should fork directly off of master!</strong></p>
        <p>As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop</p>
        <p>(or the current release branch)</p>
        <p>Hotfix-Branches are tiny Releases and they are tagged with a version number</p>

        <h2> Naming conventions</h2>

        <p><strong>release</strong>/1.2.1</p>
        <p><strong>hotfix</strong>/(SU-140-)dont-panik</p>

        <h2>Undo a finished feature</h2>
        <blockquote>Let's say you add a new feature supercool-feature which you finish (merge into development and delete the feature branch) and then it goes into a release. But then your users really dislike this supercool-feature. How can I undo/rewind/reverse this feature which has been already merged into development and a release?</blockquote>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>When you did git merge supercool-feature Git created a "merge commit" M for you. Get the Hash of this Commit and do</p>
        <pre>git revert -m 1 commit_hash</pre>

      <section>
        <h2>Get Code from another Feature- or the Develop-Branch</h2>
        <blockquote>I need this fancy stuff my collegue made yesterday!</blockquote>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>If his feature is allready finished just rebase on to development.</p>
        <p>If it's not finished yet, do a Cherrypick</p>
